Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings,

and birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old. 
Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake.

<h2>History</h2>

<p>It was baked using flour mixed with eggs, milk, nuts, and honey. They also had a cake called "satura", which was a flat, heavy cake. During the Roman period,
 the name for cake became "placenta", which was derived from the Greek term.
 A placenta was baked on a pastry base or inside a pastry case.Early cakes in England were also essentially bread:
 the most obvious differences between a "cake" and "bread" were the round, 
flat shape of the cakes and the cooking method, which turned cakes over once while cooking, while bread was left upright throughout the baking process
